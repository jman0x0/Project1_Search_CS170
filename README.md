**Problems**

For this project I worked on it by myself. Thus I encountered many problems.

First, I had difficulty designing the project because I had to design everything by myself. In particular, designing a generic, abstract, and extensible problem state class for the AStar search algorithm was difficult.

Nonetheless, the solution was developed through the use of virtual methods and inheritance.

Second, I had difficulty tracing the solution path, once a solution was found. The solution was to keep track of all explored problem state nodes in a list and have each problem state node have a previous pointer.

Third, I had difficulty managing memory and abstract class instances. Additionally, creating and managing the next reachable nodes was a struggle. 

The interface portion was not so difficult.
